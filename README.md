# Recipes

This is a simple [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) application where users can store recipe ideas along with their ingredients, 
and search for recipes by similar ingredients.
A simple [lokijs](http://lokijs.org/#/) local storage container is used for demonstration purposes, however the *external-api* 
branch has been developed to point to an external data source to allow for permanent storage. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Setup

Simply clone the repository and run ``npm install`` to setup the project. Then run ``npm run`` to get started!
