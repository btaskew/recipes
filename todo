- clear input & refresh list on add
    - Maybe move add recipe functionality somewhere else - seperate container

- research when to use pure components (for containers)

- investigate similarity between RecipeSearch and IngredientPage - both search for and display list of recipes by ingredient
    - Maybe have recipe search simply redirect to IngredientPageContainer

- Remove recipe name from route to RecipePageContainer - isn't used
- Remove ingredient id from route to IngredientPageContainer - isn't used
    - Alternatily change search function to work off of ingredient_id

STYLING
- change print width to 100
- Alert styling
- input form heading?
