- Seperate ingredient searching from RecipePageContainer into seperate IngredientListContainer that is rendered by RecipePageView

- styling for add ingredient, clear input & refresh list on add

- input form heading?
- move validation for empty input to input form component 

- sort out errors - some are handled on Page, others on specific views

- add loading states to page

- change print width to 100

- research when to use pure components (for containers)

- investigate similarity between RecipeSearch and IngredientPage - both search for and display list of recipes by ingredient
    - Maybe have recipe search simply redirect to IngredientPageContainer

- Remove recipe name from route to RecipePageContainer - isn't used
- Remove ingredient id from route to IngredientPageContainer - isn't used
    - Alternatily change search function to work off of ingredient_id
